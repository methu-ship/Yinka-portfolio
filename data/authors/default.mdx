Hello üëãüèæ
I am Yusuf Olayinka Habeeb, a Software Engineer and Technical writer. I love to build efficient, scalable services and share knowledge acquired from the process.

I build products , and write technical documentations and tutorials, also contribute to open-source projects like TigerBeetle, Subquery Network, Hedera, Rust Ethereum(Reth) etc., and worked as a technical writer for various organizations and publications, including CovalentHQ, Medium and many others.


## What I Do

### Technical Writing & Documentation Architecture
- Design and maintain comprehensive documentation systems for web3 protocols
- Create developer-focused content for APIs, SDKs, and infrastructure tools
- Write tutorials and guides that emphasize best practices in web3


## Let's Connect
I'm always interested in discussing:
- Documentation strategies for complex technical products
- Open-source developer tooling 
- Blockchain best practices and implementation patterns

Feel free to reach out through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/habeeb-yinka) or check out my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/methu-ship).
I'm interested in working on open-source developer tooling and optimizing the developer experience via the tools/libraries they use daily.
