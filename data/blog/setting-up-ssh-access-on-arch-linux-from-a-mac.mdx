I've been wanting to use my Arch Linux machine more frequently, but I don't want to keep the laptop open all the time. So, I configured SSH access so that I can use it from my primary laptop.

This guide shows how to configure an Arch Linux machine for SSH access from a Mac using key-based authentication. Both devices are on the same local network.

## On the Arch Linux Machine

### 1. Install and Start the SSH Server

Install OpenSSH if it is not already installed:

```bash
sudo pacman -S openssh
```

Start and enable the SSH daemon:

```bash
sudo systemctl start sshd
sudo systemctl enable sshd
```

Check that the SSH service is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status sshd
```

### 2. Configure SSH for Key-Based Authentication

Open the SSH configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Locate or add these lines:

```

PubkeyAuthentication yes
PasswordAuthentication no

```

**Note:** Disable password authentication only after you have confirmed that key-based access works.

Save the file and restart the SSH service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

## On Your Mac

### 3. Generate a Key Pair (If Needed)

Open Terminal on your Mac and run:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

Accept the default file location and optionally add a passphrase.

### 4. Copy Your Public Key to the Arch Linux Machine

If available, use `ssh-copy-id` to copy your key:

```bash
ssh-copy-id username@local-ip-of-arch-linux
```

Replace `username` with your Arch Linux username and `local-ip-of-arch-linux` with the machine's local IP address.

If ssh-copy-id is not installed, display your public key with:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Then manually paste the key into the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on your Arch Linux machine.

### 5. Connect via SSH

Use the local IP address of your Arch Linux machine to connect:

```bash
ssh username@local-ip-of-arch-linux
```

Replace `username` and `local-ip-of-arch-linux` with your actual username and the machine's IP address.

### 6. Simplify the Login Process

To make sure you don't have to type the connection command all the time, you can create an alias like so:

```bash
alias archlinux="ssh username@local-ip-of-arch-linux"
```

### Optional: Disabling Auto Suspend on Arch Linux

If you're like me and you want to use your Arch linux machine as a server or playground of some sort, you can disable the auto-suspend behavior when you close the Lid of your laptop running Arch. To do this:

Locate the `logind.conf` file by running:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/logind.conf
```

Un-comment the following lines:

```conf
HandleLidSwitchExternalPower=ignore
HandleLidSwitch=ignore
```

_Make sure the above options are set to `ignore` and un-commented._

Next, restart the logind service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind.service
```

**Note:** This might freeze your GUI and ask you to login again. If after logging in and you have a dark screen after a while, force shut the machine and turn it back on.

## Summary

This guide walks you through setting up SSH access from your Mac to an Arch Linux machine on the same local network using key-based authentication. After verifying that the connection works, consider additional security measures if needed.
