Running a dev node allows you to experiment with deploying and testing your smart contracts before deploying them to the live Arbitrum network. If you’re coming from a Solidity background, you’ll be familiar with this workflow; it’s similar to running a local devnet using Hardhat or Anvil in Foundry.

### Step 1: Install Prerequisites
 - Docker Desktop

Go [to](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and install Docker for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux). After installation, open Docker so it runs in the background.

 - Foundry

Install Foundry for testing your contract in the dev environment:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```
This installs forge, cast, and other tools.

### Step 2: Get the Nitro Dev Node

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-devnode.git
cd nitro-devnode
```

This downloads the official Nitro dev node scripts.

### Step 3: Start the Nitro Dev Node

In the nitro devnode directory, start the Arbitrum node:

```bash
./run-dev-node.sh
```

Once it runs successfully, you should see output similar to the example shown above.

### Step 4: Testing

Open a new terminal and run:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8547/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}'
```

You should get back a hex number (like “0x7”). If so, congratulations, you’re all set.

And that’s it! We’ve successfully set up a local dev node using Arbitrum Nitro. Next, we’ll see how to scaffold a Stylus project, test it, and deploy a contract on the devnet. Till then, happy coding.
