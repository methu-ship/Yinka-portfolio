Services in Linux help you configure software to run in the background as well as follow the right order of startup.

## Useful Commands For Managing Services in Linux

- To start a service, run any of the following commands:
    
    ```Bash
    service <service-name> start # Debian, RHEL, SLES
    
    systemctl start <service-name> # For Linux distributions that use systemd as their init system
    ```
    
- To stop a service, run the following command:
    
    ```Bash
    systemctl stop <service-name>
    ```
    
- To check the status of a service run the following command:
    
    ```Bash
    systemctl status <service-name>
    ```
    
- To configure a service to run at system boot, run the following command:
    
    ```Bash
    systemctl enable <service-name>
    ```
    
- To disable a service from running at system boot, run the following command:
    
    ```Bash
    systemctl disable <service-name>
    ```

## How To Configure a Program To Run As a Service in Linux
To create a service, you need to configure it using a systemd unit file. Name the file after the service you want to create and save it in the `/usr/lib/systemd/system` directory with a `.service` extension.

Use the following template to set up your service:
    
```bash
# my_app.service

[Unit]
Description= <service description>

[Service]
ExectStart=<command used to run the program>
ExecStartPre=<Command to run before starting the program>
ExecStartPost=<Command to run after starting the program>
Restart=always # will restart the service if it crashes

[Install] # useful for allowing service to start at boot
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```    

Now, run the following command to reload the system

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
```

You can now manage the service using the commands mentioned above!
